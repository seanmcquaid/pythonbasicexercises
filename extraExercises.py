# 1. Hello, you!
# Prompt the user for his name using the input function. Example:

# name = input('What is your name? ')
# Upon receiving his name, you will say hello to him. Example session:

# $ python hello.py What is your name? Toby Hello, Toby!
# 2. HELLO, YOU!
# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name. Example session:

# $ python hello2.py WHAT IS YOUR NAME? Toby HELLO, TOBY! YOUR NAME HAS 4 LETTERS IN IT! AWESOME!
# 3. Madlib
# Prompt the user for the missing words to a Madlib sentence using the input function. You will make up your own Madlib sentence, but here's an example:

# ____(name)____'s favorite subject in school is ____(subject)____.
# With the above given sentence, this is what a user session might look like:

# $ python madlib.py Please fill in the blanks below: ____(name)____'s favorite subject in school is ____(subject)____. What is name? Marty What is subject? math Marty's favorite subject in school is math.
# 4. Day of the Week
# Given the following code that prompts the user for a day number (the int function converts a numeric string to a number):

# day = int(input('Day (0-6)? ')) # Fill in your code here
# The user will enter a number between 0 to 6 inclusive. Given this number, print a day of the week. 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so on. Here's an example user session (this assumes you've named the file day_of_week.py):

# $ python day_of_week.py Day (0-6)? 5 Friday $ python day_of_week.py Day (0-6)? 0 Sunday
# 5. Work or Sleep In?
# Prompt the user for a day of the week just like the previous problem. Except this time print "Go to work" if it's a work day and "Sleep in" if it's a weekend day. Example session:

# $ python work_or_sleep_in.py Day (0-6)? 5 Go to work $ python work_or_sleep_in.py Day (0-6)? 6 Sleep in
# 6. Celsius to Fahrenheit
# Prompt the user for a number in degrees Celsius, and convert the value to degrees in Fahrenheit and display it to the user. Example session:

# $ python degree_conversion.py Temperature in C? 28 82.4 F $ python degree_conversion.py Temperature in C? -5 23 F
# Hint: the formula to convert degrees C to degrees F is: F = C x 1.8 + 32.

# 7. Tip Calculator
# Prompt the user for two things:

# The total bill amount:
# The level of service, which can be one of the following: good, fair, or bad
# Calculate the tip amount and the total amount (bill amount + tip amount). The tip percentage based on the level of service is based on:

# good -> 20%
# fair -> 15%
# bad -> 10%
# Example session: $ python tip_calc.py Total bill amount? 100 Level of service? good Tip amount: $20.00 Total amount: $120.00 $ python tip_calc.py Total bill amount? 48 Level of service? bad Tip amount: $4.80 Total amount: $52.80
# Hints:

# To format a float number as a dollar value, use Python's formatting syntax: "{:.2f}".format(amount)
# 8. Tip Calculator 2
# Allow the ability to divide the check into a equal parts amount a number of people. The user will enter the number of people to be divided amongst. Example session:

# $ python tip_calc2.py Total bill amount? 100 Level of service? good Split how many ways? 5 Tip amount: $20.00 Total amount: $120.00 Amount per person: $24.00
# 9. 1 to 10
# Use a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

# $ python 1_to_10.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# 10. How many coins?
# Write a program that will prompt you for how many coins you want. Initially you have no coins. It will ask you if you want a coin? If you type "yes", it will give you one coin, and print out the current tally. If you type no, it will stop the program. Example run:

# $ python coins.py You have 0 coins. Do you want another? yes You have 1 coins. Do you want another? yes You have 2 coins. Do you want another? no Bye
